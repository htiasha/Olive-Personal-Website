       <h2>Who I am</h2>
       <h1>About me</h1>
       <hr>
        <p>Olive Ghosh, an Artist from West Bengal, India.I grew up within an Indian Music Culture Atmosphere, I have excelled in Indian Classical Music,Blues and Jazz and also an expert on Indian Folk Instruments.
        I am a Gold Medalist artist on Fine arts and quite passionate on Expressionism Arts. I have Started doing Music at the age of 3 and later on formed a High School Metal Band known as the "Eleventh Hour" and as soon as I completed my High School, I joined as an Arranger and a Keyboardist in a Modern Psychedelic Progressive Band, known as " Vesper Service" in the year 2016 along with my family demand of pursuing  degree on Electronics and Communication engineering. In the middle of 2017, formed my own Sound Production setup known as "Keybee Soundscape" with a distant hope to bring out some new and different Soundscapes and finally at the end of 2018, launched my Debut Album, known as "Breakdown" where I tried to portray all the types of Breakdowns that I faced while being on the edge of handling  Love, Career and  own Mind. I hope to deliver more new contents on new and diverse soundscapes.<p>
